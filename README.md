# Contact Book

## Objective
This project aims to build a contact book web application using Vue 3, Vue Router 4, Vite, and local storage. The application allows users to view, search, add, edit, and delete contacts. Data is stored in local storage, and Vue Router is used for navigation between multiple views.

## Features
- **View Contacts**: Display contacts in alphabetical order by last name.
- **Search Contacts**: Filter contacts by their first or last name.
- **Contact Details**: Clicking on a contact's name will display detailed information.
- **Add Contact**: A form allows users to add a new contact to the contact book.
- **Delete Contact**: A button to delete contacts from the web application and local storage.
- **Local Storage**: All data is persisted using the browser's local storage.

## Requirements
1. Vue 3, Vue Router 4, Vite for the frontend framework and routing.
2. Local storage for storing contacts data.
3. Vue Router for controlling views: a contact list view, a contact detail view, and forms for adding and editing contacts.
4. The app should have an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
5. Use open-source frameworks or libraries to enhance UI design.
